    "(a) Prior on logistic regression output when using $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\omega )$ prior for the offset term, for $\\omega =10$ or $\\omega =1.5$. Adapted from Figure 11.3 of \\citep{rethinking2}. Generated by [logreg_prior_offset.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book2/14/logreg_prior_offset.ipynb). (b) Distribution over the fraction of 1s we expect to see when using binary logistic regression applied to random binary feature vectors of increasing dimensionality. We use a $\\mathcal{N}(0,1.5)$ prior on the regression coefficients. Adapted from Figure 3 of \\citep{Gelman2020workflow}. Generated by [logreg_prior.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book2/14/logreg_prior.ipynb)."
